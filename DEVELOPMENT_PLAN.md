## üö® RISK MANAGEMENT

### Identified Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Highrise Lua API limitations | High | Early testing, simple fallbacks |
| Shader compatibility issues | Medium | Test early on mobile, standard URP shaders |
| Multiplayer sync complexity | High | Use Highrise built-in systems, avoid custom networking |
| Time constraints (interviews, BGS) | Medium | Front-load core gameplay, buffer on Day 8 |
| VFX performance on mobile | Medium | Optimize particle counts, use GPU particles sparingly |

### Contingency Plans

**If core gameplay takes longer than Day 4:**
- Simplify state machine (remove lobby, go straight to Hide phase)
- Remove spectator mode
- Basic UI only (text, no graphics)

**If shaders don't work as planned:**
- Use standard URP shaders with creative material setup
- Focus on VFX and lighting instead
- Document shader attempt in write-up

**If multiplayer is too complex:**
- Create single-player prototype with AI hunters
- Document multiplayer architecture theoretically
- Show that systems are "multiplayer-ready"

## üìù DAILY LOG

### Day 1 (Oct 6) - Log
**Completed:**
- ‚úÖ GitHub repository initialized and pushed
- ‚úÖ Project analysis complete
- ‚úÖ Development plan created (530-line comprehensive roadmap)
- ‚úÖ SpaceNavigator partial integration (workaround script using reflection)
- ‚úÖ Explored Highrise Lua structure from package cache examples
- ‚úÖ Found Highrise Studio documentation portal (create.highrise.game)
- ‚úÖ Reviewed best practices for optimization, UI, security

**Blockers:**
- Need to explore full API reference for multiplayer/server features
- Need to test basic Lua script creation workflow in Unity

**Next Session:**
- Navigate to https://create.highrise.game/learn/studio/scripting to find API details
- Test basic Lua script creation (Hello World)
- Import scene assets and begin layout
- List specific props for the game

**Notes:**
- SpaceNavigator has limited functionality (pan/zoom only, no rotation) due to Highrise editor restrictions
- Created `ForceSpaceNavigator.cs` workaround using reflection to bypass UI restrictions
- Framework uses Lua with `--!Type(Server)` and `--!Type(Client)` annotations
- Highrise emphasizes: optimize assets, reduce polygons, test on mobile devices
- Documentation available at create.highrise.game/learn/studio
